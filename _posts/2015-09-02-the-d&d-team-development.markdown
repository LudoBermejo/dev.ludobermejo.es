All of us have tripped over the same stone one or twice. Maybe you are looking for a job, maybe you need to hire a developer to make your website. You check Linkedin, personal blogs, github pages. They are everywhere: "Ninjas", "Rockstars", "Gurus", "Full stack developers". Every year they change the term so it doesn't get too oldish. But, `what do they mean`? 

Well, initially it was just another ways to denominate `experts`. But you know how weird is this little world of us: we are fashion victims. We love to invent new words to make us special, to distinguish ourselves from the others. Soon enough the headhunters were looking first for gurus, then ninjas, after that rockstars, now "fullstackers". Pick your poison. These marvellous words explodes in our minds, like, "oh, this guys are so brilliant. They know the tech, they collaborate with it, they are famous. Let's make a team with all of them; we will be unstoppable". 

Well... no.

I've spend some years with development teams and I don't like the concept of `full experts team`. Don't make me wrong; I mean, I love experts, those guys can achieve whenever they want. But they have problems. Of course I'm oversimplifying things but, you know, maybe "ninja" is a little oversimplified too. 
  
So, if I don't like this `fullstackmotherfockersofhells-teams`, what are my idea of an ideal team?

Well... I'm glad you asked. Please, allow me to be your nerdist host in this wonderful trip to the geeky side of the development world. Let me present you the:

`D&D Team-party crappy theory (®)`

So, I think every team needs a couple of roles. I don't speak about "designer, layout, back and front". I mean people who can make diverse approaches to problems, with particular solutions and better than that, with different highs and lows. Along the years I have been involved with lots of teams, some of them successful and some... well, no. The most successful were the old ones, and they all share certain member characteristics: 
    
+ Different behaviours
+ Different ages
+ Different nature
+ Different area of knowledge

And how can we distinguish between this different roles? Are they all ninjas? Hard-workers? Genius? Ah, that hole is filled with my `D&D Team-party crappy theory (®)`. Because you know, in D&D we have  
     
## Characters Classes
     
Yeah... i bet you were waiting for it. Another list of words to make ourselves happy.
     
What can I say?
     
Did you see the "crappy" in the title of the theory?
     
And now shut up and listen to this. At least I hope it would be interesting :)     
     
### The warrior

Maybe she is not the best coder in the world. Maybe she doesn't read every feed of flashy-techie-new-techs. But man, she is a certain value. She can spend so many hours hitting the wall, learning and understaing everything she needs to work. And the most important thing: she never, ever, gives up. But some times they are stubborn and slowly, and they don't accept the changes until you hit them with the reality.

### The wizard

'Do not meddle in the affairs of wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger.'

Ok, Tolkien knew it. The Wizard are your famous ninjas. They are wonderful, they know everything, they have the most beautiful code you ever seen. But they are proud and their frustration tolerance is almost zero. They yell at your business experts, they can be patronizing. You know them. They are cool and insufferable.

### The thief

"What do you mean it's done?"

They are quick. What am I saying? They are the mother-fucking-flash. They knew all the hacks,
