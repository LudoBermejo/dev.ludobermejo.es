This will be quick. At least we have a `for ... of` loop in Javascript. It is used in `Iterables` (we talk about them in a future post). But for know, look at this code:

    var mortalKombatCharacters = ["Sub-zero", "Scorpion", "Johhny Cage", 
            "Shang Tsung", "Raiden", "Sonya Blade", "Liu Kang", "Goro"]
            
    for(let name of mortalKombatCharacters) {
        console.log(name);
    }

Will return
    
    Sub-zero
    Scorpion
    Johhny Cage
    Shang Tsung
    Raiden
    Sonya Blade
    Liu Kang
    Goro
    
Let's do it with strings:
    
    var whosTheChosenOne = "Neo is the chosen one";
            
    for(let letter of whosTheChosenOne) {
        console.log(letter);
    }
    
Returns 
    
    N
    e
    o
     
    i
    s
     
    t
    h
    e
     
    c
    h
    o
    s
    e
    n
     
    o
    n
    e

We will come back to this for...of when we talk about `iterables` and `generators`. Just wait for it!
