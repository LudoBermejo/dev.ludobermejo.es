Today I'm not showing my usual posts about patters. That's because I've started a course about Unity3D, the game development platform. As you may know I love computer games and I made some of them in the old flash days. A lot of friends are professional designers, artits or developers of great games, so when I saw the course I simply could not resist to start with it.
 
I expended a couple of hours with this and I'm very excited with the results. I think I could make my own mini-game in a few weeks. Meanwhile, you can check this. It's done in thirty minutes and it's awesome!
